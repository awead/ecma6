# ECMA Script 6 in Rails

Demo application to demonstrate some patterns of using ECMA 6 Javascript within the context of a
Rails application.

## Usage

    bundle install
    bundle exec rails s

## Tests

    bundle exec rake jasmine

And then test on localhost:8888

## Notes

I've used some examples from Sandi Metz's [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/).
The rest comes from Dr. Axel Rauschmayer's  [Exploring ES6](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html)
